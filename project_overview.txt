# Stock Analysis Trading System Project Overview

## Current Status
We are developing a stock analysis trading system that uses Google Apps Script to interface with a Python backend. The system currently consists of:

1. A Google Sheet with a "Stock Picker" tab that displays stock data including:
   - Basic stock information (Symbol, Price)
   - Technical indicators (RSI, Stochastic, ADX)
   - Options data (IV, IV Rank, Delta, Theta)
   - Trading signals and hedge flags

2. A Google Apps Script (stock_analysis.gs) that:
   - Creates and formats the "Stock Picker" tab
   - Connects to a local Python backend API (http://localhost:5000/update_stock_analysis)
   - Updates the spreadsheet with the latest stock data

## Project Goals
The goal is to build a comprehensive stock analysis system that:
1. Provides technical analysis for stock trading decisions
2. Displays options data for derivatives trading
3. Generates trading signals based on technical indicators
4. Identifies potential hedge opportunities

## Development Plan
1. **Current Phase**: Basic setup and API integration
   - ✅ Create spreadsheet structure
   - ✅ Implement basic API connection to Python backend
   - ⬜ Add comprehensive API testing capabilities
   - ⬜ Implement data validation

2. **Next Phase**: Enhanced Analysis Features
   - ⬜ Add more technical indicators
   - ⬜ Implement custom trading strategies
   - ⬜ Add historical performance tracking
   - ⬜ Create visualization dashboards

3. **Future Phase**: Advanced Trading Features
   - ⬜ Automated trading signals
   - ⬜ Risk management calculations
   - ⬜ Portfolio optimization
   - ⬜ Backtesting capabilities

## API Integration
The system currently integrates with a Python backend running locally on port 5000. The only endpoint currently used is:
- http://localhost:5000/update_stock_analysis (POST)

Additional API endpoints will need to be developed and tested as the system grows.

## Development Guidelines
1. All changes must be thoroughly documented
2. Before modifying any file, the entire codebase should be reviewed
3. API tests should be implemented for all endpoints
4. Changes should be tracked in this overview document
